# TurbulenceMachineLearning
Machine learning of wind farm turbulence features.
This repo uses tensor basis decision tree based models developed in scikit-learn (see my other repo) to learn the anisotropy tensor (bij) of the turbulent shear stress of high fidelity wind farm LES based on SOWFA.
Verification and validation were based on periodic hills of various Re.
